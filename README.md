# Python Web Spider

This Python script parses the HTTP response(s) from one or more URLs for key words.  
I wrote this program for Applications of Information Security (ISI 312) at Ferris State University.

## What I Learned
* Sending HTTP Requests with Cookies
* HTTP Response Parsing
* File I/O in Python

## Installation
1. Install Python 2.7
2. Set the URLs in the links.txt file, one URL per line
3. Run this program `python web_spider.py`
